As you know in Java we have been using java and javac commands for interpret(run) and compile it
so we will use scala and scalac commands for interpret(run) and compile

We knew already after compile of java codes there will be "*.class" files(it called JVM bytecode) so in Scala there will be same so
because scala works on JVM too.

there is a command named "tree" which is available in Windows like "tree /F"

Some scala files needed to be choosen for compile or interpret: scala files which include Class, they should be compiled.
If there is no class they can be interpreted.

scalac -d <destination folder> *.scala 

Above command will compile the all scala files into destination folder as class files
